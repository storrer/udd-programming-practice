"""
There is at least one baby name from the top 40 baby names for 2020 that, 
when spelled backwards, is a valid Scrabble word. Find and print all such 
names. Solve this two ways: first with an array to hold the Scrabble words, 
and then with a dictionary (or set) to hold the Scrabble words. Use timer 
functions to measure how long it takes to complete this work under each 
implementation. Why is the time different?
