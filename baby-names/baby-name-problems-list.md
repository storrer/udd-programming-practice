**More for loops, if conditions, and storage**

# What is the shortest baby name in the top 40 baby names for 2020?
# What are the longest baby names in the top 40 baby names for 2020? Make sure you can handle if thereâ€™s a tie.

**Nested for loops**

# There is at least one baby name from the top 40 baby names for 2020 that, when spelled backwards, is a valid Scrabble word. Find and print all such names.Solve this two ways: first with an array to hold the Scrabble words, and then with a dictionary (or set) to hold the Scrabble words. Use timer functions to measure how long it takes to complete this work under each implementation. Why is the time different?
# What are all of the names that were top 40 baby names in both 1880 and 2020?
